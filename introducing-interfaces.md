# Introducing Interfaces
An interface is a little bit like a class without an implementation. It specifies a set of characteristics and behaviors by defining signatures for methods, properties, events, and indexers, without specifying how any of these members are implemented. When a class implements an interface, the class provides an implementation for each member of the interface. By implementing the interface, the class is thereby guaranteeing that it will provide the functionality specified by the interface.

Note the important distinction when using an Interface. A class "implements" an interface as opposed to "inheriting" a base class.
